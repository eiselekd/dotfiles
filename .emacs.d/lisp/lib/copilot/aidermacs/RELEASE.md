*   **Flexible Terminal Backend Support:** Choose between `comint` and `vterm` backends for the best terminal compatibility and performance.
*   **Enhanced File Management:** Easily manage files within your Aider session with commands for adding, dropping, listing, and more. Full support for remote files via Tramp (SSH, Docker, etc.).
